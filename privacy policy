My mobile app privacy policy explains:
- What information my app accesses and why
- How my app uses that information

#Information my app accesses and how that information is used

The app does not access camera, microphone, location or any other permission, except the internet permission. The app downloads small images to make the experience for the user better
After the app has downloaded the images, the app will not access the internet again, except if the user clicks on the icon in the top right corner. This will take the user to a thir-party website.

This privacy policy can get updated
